        			Woooooooooo! Wow, this is official. Hello world, you may take one look at my site now and see it for how bare it is, and rightfully so. I don't know much regarding web development. I know it, you <em>probably</em> know it, but I am ok with that. This is the beginning of my site, but the middle of my journey. And man, what a journey its been just to get <span class="highlight">here</span>. But now's not the time to reminisce, but to look forward to all the good that's coming. The main focus right now is getting my first position in web development. I'm currently coding 2-4 hours daily, and hope to be interview ready come summertime. Learning, applying, and growing every day will get me there. I know it will take some time, but I am ok with that. I know what I possess, and I know that I will make an impact wherever this leads me.  I'm here, world. My best is yet to come...and I'm ok with that
        		</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
