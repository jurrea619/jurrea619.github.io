        			Woooooooooo! Wow, this is official. Hello world, you may take one look at my site now and see it for how bare it is, and rightfully so. I don't know much regarding web development. I know this, you <em>probably</em> know this, and I am ok with it. This is the beginning of my site, but the middle of my journey. And what a journey it has been just to get here. But now's not the time to reminisce, but to look forward to all the good that's coming. I know what I possess, and I know that I will make an impact wherever this leads. Learning, applying, and growing every day will get me there. I'm here! The best is yet to come. And I am ok with it 
        		</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
