        			Woooooooooo! Wow, this is official. Hello world, you may take one look at my site now and see it for how bare it is, and rightfully so. I don't know much regarding web development. I know this, you know this, and I am ok with it. This is the beginning of my site, but the middle of my journey. And what a journey it has been. The people, places, and lessons of my past have all lead me to his point. Learning, applying, and growing every day to achieve my goals. Where this takes me, I am excited to see.
        		</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
