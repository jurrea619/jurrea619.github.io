    				With so many resources online aimed to learn and/or improve programming skills, at times I felt like I was drowning in options. How do I know I am spending my time wisely to efficiently build up my skills?  Well, through my daily devouring of Reddit news and articles I came across a user who posted a guide put together with the best free courses available from various sites across the internet. Naturally skeptic, I had to read through a quite a few positive comments from fellow programmers before I decided to make <a href = "https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides">P1xt's guide</a> my course of focus. After a few <a target="_blank" href="khanacademy.com">Khan Academy</a> courses, I am now in the early stages of the Full Stack Course offered through App Academy Open and I love it!!! Learning a new language, Ruby, while freshening up more programming skills every day. Site updates and more projects will start being added once this Full Stack Course is completed.

        			Woooooooooo! Wow, this is official. Hello world, you may take one look at my site now and see it for how bare it is, and rightfully so. I don't know much regarding web development. I know it, you <em>probably</em> know it by now, and I'm ok with that. This is the beginning of my site, but the middle of my journey. And man, what a journey its been for me just to get <b><u>here</u></b>. But now's not the time to reminisce, but to look forward to all the good that's coming. My main goal for 2021 is getting a  position in the web development industry. Learning and growing every day will get me there. I know it will take some time, and I'm ok with that. I know what I possess, and that I will make an impact wherever this leads me.<br><br>I'm here, world. My best is yet to come...and I'm ok with that
