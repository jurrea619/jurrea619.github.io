        			Woooooooooo! Wow, this is official. Hello world, you may take one look at my site now and see it for how bare it is, and rightfully so. I don't know much regarding web development. I know it, you <em>probably</em> know it by now, and I'm ok with that. This is the beginning of my site, but the middle of my journey. And man, what a journey its been for me just to get <span class="highlight">here</span>. But now's not the time to reminisce, but to look forward to all the good that's coming. My main goal for 2021 is getting a  position in the web development industry. Learning and growing every day will get me there. I know it will take some time, and I'm ok with that. I know what I possess, and that I will make an impact wherever this leads me. I can feel it. <br><br>I'm here, world. My best is yet to come...and I'm ok with that
        		</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
